# Frontend Challenge Starter Code -

This is the starter code for the WDI SEA 05 challenge.
It's a simple Node.js back end that makes a call to the Yelp API for the top 25 rated resturants in Seattle.

## The routes so far...

"/" - The Hompage, which has some JSON data being passed to it.

"/api" - View of the JSON data being passed to the front end.

It's your job to build a front end to visualize this data.

Your options for this assignment:

 - Choose an unfamiliar CSS library and Jquery Plugin, or
 - Use an unfamiliar JavaScript front end library.

Look to the Homework readme for info or ideas on what to use.
